I received B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from the School of Computer Science, [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/), in 2016 and 2019, respectively, supervised by [Prof. Qing Wang](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/qwang.html). I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Computer Science, [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) supervised by [Prof. Junhui Hou](https://sites.google.com/site/junhuihoushomepage/biography). My research interests include **novel view synthesis**, **light field**, and **computational photography**.
